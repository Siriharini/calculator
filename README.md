Welcome to Calculator, a sleek and functional web-based calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with additional features like decimal support and error handling. 
##Simple Calculator
A sleek, responsive, and fully functional calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project delivers a robust and user-friendly calculator application, perfect for everyday arithmetic operations. Crafted with a focus on clean design and efficient functionality, it showcases the power of fundamental web technologies â€“ HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive logic.

##Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease.
Clear & Delete Functionality: C to clear the entire display and DEL to remove the last entered digit.
Decimal Support: Handle floating-point numbers for precise calculations.
Percentage Functionality: Easily calculate percentages.
Keyboard Support: Seamlessly interact with the calculator using your keyboard's number pad and operation keys.
Responsive Design: Adapts beautifully to various screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors, ensuring a consistent user experience.
Intuitive User Interface: A clean, modern, and easy-to-navigate layout that mimics traditional calculators.
Error Handling: Basic handling for division by zero.
##Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the foundational structure and semantic markup for the calculator's layout and elements.
CSS3: Styles the calculator to give it a visually appealing and modern look, including responsive design, button styling, and layout.
JavaScript (ES6+): Powers the core logic of the calculator, handling all user interactions, calculations, display updates, and keyboard input.
##How It Works
The calculator's functionality is driven by a well-structured JavaScript codebase.The input is then processed to build the mathematical expression. When an operation button or the equals button is pressed, the JavaScript evaluates the expression using techniques that prioritize operator precedence (though for basic calculators, a simple left-to-right evaluation often suffices for common operations). The display is dynamically updated to show current input and results, providing immediate feedback to the user. Keyboard input is also mapped to the corresponding calculator functions for enhanced usability.
